# CPUAffinityGameBooster™

CPUAffinityGameBooster™ is a closed-source process optimization service for games. This program optimizes core allocations for games to improve performance and reduce lags. We support modern CPU architectures such as AMD 3D V-Cache™ and Intel P+E cores.

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. Use at your own risk.

### Supported CPU's
